🎯 Prodigy Infotech Internship – Task 1
Data Visualization Using Python (Bar Chart & Histogram)                                                                                                                        
 📌 Objective:

The goal of this task is to perform basic data visualization by plotting:

A bar chart for a categorical variable

A histogram for a continuous variable

  Dataset

The project uses the Titanic dataset from Seaborn, an inbuilt dataset commonly used for data visualization and analysis.

 Tools & Technologies

. Python

. Pandas

. Seaborn

. Matplotlib

. Jupyter Notebook

 Visualizations Performed
 
1️⃣ Bar Chart – Gender Distribution

A bar chart was plotted using the sex column to visualize the count of male and female passengers aboard the Titanic.

2️⃣ Histogram – Age Distribution

A histogram was plotted using the age column to understand the distribution and frequency of passengers across different age groups.

📘 Notebook

All code and outputs are included in the Jupyter Notebook:
prodigy-infotech-task 1.ipynb

 Outcome:

This task demonstrates the basics of data visualization, helping understand how categorical and continuous variables behave in a dataset using simple yet effective graphical representations.
